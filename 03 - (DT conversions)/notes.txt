Since whenever we are reading data from client/server there is no guarantee of the datatype being constant.
Due to which we should be checking types.


//converting this into a number.
let stringToNumber = Number(score);
console.log(typeof stringToNumber);

for an instance, the above code will spit "Number" but when we will log the stringToNumber
this will spit out not a number NaN YIKES!!!
