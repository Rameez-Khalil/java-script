Since whenever we are reading data from client/server there is no guarantee of the datatype being constant.
Due to which we should be checking types.


//converting this into a number.
let stringToNumber = Number(score);
console.log(typeof stringToNumber);

for an instance, the above code will spit "Number" but when we will log the stringToNumber
this will spit out not a number NaN YIKES!!!


1. if we try to convert null to number then this will be successfully done.
However, this will spit out 0.
 
2. if we try to convert undefined to a number then this will also be successfull.
However, this will spit out NaN.

3. for boolean true will be converted back to 1 and vice versa.
