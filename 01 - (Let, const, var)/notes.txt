These are memory spaces.
const - cannot be changed after sometime.
let - capable of getting changed.

CONST: locks the value. If we try to change the value then it will spit out type error (Assignment to const var)


VARIABLE DECLARATION: 
In intial days there was no scoping involved 
let and const were introduced to avoid this issue.


GLOBAL VAR: 
when we do not use any scoping term before our var this eventually results a global var.

UNDEFINED: 
When we declare a variable and not assign any value this results in undefined.
